/**
 * A change to a balance the writer could not apply itself.
 *
 * <p>A market sale to somebody on another server, a reward for somebody
 * offline: the server making it does not own that player's snapshot, so it
 * leaves the change here and tells the network. Whoever owns the player — now
 * or on their next join — takes each row by deleting it and folds it in, which
 * is what makes a change applied exactly once however many servers saw the
 * message.
 *
 * <p>Keyed like a balance row: the currency's id, or {@code id@server} for a
 * currency each server keeps its own of, which only that server claims.
 *
 * @param absolute whether {@code amount} replaces the balance rather than
 *                 adding to it — an admin {@code set} from elsewhere
